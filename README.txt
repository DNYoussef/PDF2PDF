Certainly! I'll lay out the project as if I were managing a new software engineer, including the scope, tech stack with reasoning, information flow, and file structure.

Project Scope:
Our project, which we'll call "DocuRefine," aims to transform poorly formatted or scanned documents into searchable, editable PDFs while preserving the original layout. The system will handle both PDFs and image inputs, process them page by page, and output a refined PDF document.

Key features:
1. PDF splitting and image processing
2. OCR for text extraction
3. Layout analysis
4. Text-to-LaTeX conversion
5. Image comparison for quality control
6. PDF reconstruction

Tech Stack:
1. Python 3.8+: Our primary programming language due to its rich ecosystem of libraries for AI and document processing.

2. PyPDF2: For PDF manipulation (splitting and merging).
   Reason: Pure Python library, easy to use and integrate.

3. Tesseract (via pytesseract): For OCR.
   Reason: Open-source, widely used, and supports multiple languages.

4. Layout Parser: For document layout analysis.
   Reason: Provides pre-trained models for various document types.

5. Hugging Face Transformers: For text-to-LaTeX conversion.
   Reason: State-of-the-art NLP models, easy to fine-tune and use.

6. scikit-image: For image comparison (SSIM).
   Reason: Comprehensive image processing library with the required metrics.

7. OpenCV (cv2): For image preprocessing.
   Reason: Powerful image processing capabilities, works well with scikit-image.

8. Celery: For task queue and parallel processing.
   Reason: Allows for efficient processing of multiple pages simultaneously.

9. Redis: As a message broker for Celery.
   Reason: Fast, lightweight, and works well with Celery.

Information Flow:

<rationale>
This file structure separates concerns, making the project modular and easy to navigate. It includes directories for source code, tests, pre-trained models, configuration, and documentation. This structure facilitates collaborative development and makes it easier to maintain and scale the project.
</rationale>

Implementation Plan:

1. Set up the project structure and install dependencies.
2. Implement and test individual components (PDF utils, OCR, layout analysis, etc.).
3. Develop a prototype of the LaTeX conversion model using Hugging Face Transformers.
4. Create a basic version of the main script to process a single page.
5. Implement Celery tasks for parallel processing.
6. Develop the image comparison and refinement loop.
7. Create the final PDF merging functionality.
8. Implement comprehensive error handling and logging.
9. Optimize performance and refine the LaTeX conversion model.
10. Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing.

Key Challenges:

1. Accurately converting complex layouts to LaTeX.
2. Handling various types of input documents and image qualities.
3. Optimizing performance for large documents.
4. Ensuring high accuracy in the refined PDFs.

<rationale>
This implementation plan breaks down the project into manageable steps, allowing for incremental development and testing. It prioritizes building a working prototype before optimizing and scaling the system.
</rationale>

Next Steps for the New Engineer:

1. Review the project structure and tech stack.
2. Set up the development environment with all required dependencies.
3. Start implementing the PDF splitting functionality in `pdf_utils.py`.
4. Write corresponding unit tests in `tests/test_pdf_utils.py`.
5. Move on to implementing the OCR functionality in `ocr.py`.

Remember to commit your changes frequently and write clear, concise commit messages. We'll have code reviews for each completed component.

Do you have any questions about the project structure or implementation plan? Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the system?
