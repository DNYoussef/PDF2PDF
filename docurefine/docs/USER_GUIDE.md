# DocuRefine User Guide

DocuRefine is a tool for transforming poorly formatted or scanned documents into searchable, editable PDFs while preserving the original layout.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/docurefine.git
   cd docurefine
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - Update the values in `.env` as needed, especially:
     - `SECRET_KEY`: Set this to a random, secure string
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Set your database URL (default is SQLite)
     - `REDIS_URL`: Set your Redis URL (default is localhost)
     - `SENTRY_DSN`: Set this if you're using Sentry for error tracking

5. Initialize the database:
   ```
   flask db upgrade
   ```

6. Start the Redis server (if not already running)

7. Start the Celery worker:
   ```
   celery -A celery_worker worker --loglevel=info
   ```

8. Start the Flask development server:
   ```
